Exploratory Data Analysis of Premier League 2023/24 Player Stats
# ⚽ Premier League 2023/24 — Exploratory Data Analysis

This project was completed as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**, focusing on real-world data analytics using Python. The dataset contains detailed player statistics from the 2023/24 Premier League season.

## 📊 Project Overview

This EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) explores the performance of players in terms of:

- Goals and Assists
- Expected Goals (xG) vs Actual Goals
- Progressive Carries
- Positional and Age Distributions

The goal was to extract insights from real football data using Python and visualize patterns using modern tools.

## 📁 Dataset Summary

The dataset includes the following fields for each player:

- `Player`, `Nation`, `Team`, `Pos`, `Age`
- `Min`, `Starts`, `90s`, `Gls`, `Ast`, `G+A`
- `xG`, `xAG`, `npxG`, `npxG+xAG`
- `CrdY`, `CrdR`, `PK`, `PKatt`, `Progressive Carries`, etc.

> 📌 No manual download needed — data was directly loaded and analyzed from a pre-prepared dataset.
